# inmydata Progress OpenEdge Sample Project

This sample project demonstrates how to integrate and use **inmydata OCX desktop components** within a **Progress OpenEdge GUI application**.

## Project Overview

The project includes sample `.w` files that illustrate how to:

- Embed inmydata OCX controls in a Progress GUI form
- Pass configuration data to the components
- Display copilot, insights, dashboards and visualisations from the inmydata platform
- Handle events and interactions using Progress ABL

This can be used as a reference when integrating inmydata controls into existing OpenEdge desktop applications.

## Files Included

- `main.w`: The main window and control initialisation - ** RUN THIS TO START
- `full.w` : Example of embedding the full inmydata UI
- `aichat.w`: Example of embedding the copilot view
- `dashboard.w`: Example of embedding a dashboard view
- `insights.w`: Example of embedding the insights view
- `visualisation.w` : Example of embedding the visualisation view
- `insightsViz.w`, `aiChatViz.w`: Supporting screens with various combinations of inmydata OCX controls

## Requirements
